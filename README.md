A hub wordpress plugin with a nice meta-box. This uses the same style uploader as the featured image meta box, ajax and all.

#Installing#

Copy the plugin folder to wp-content/plugins and rename to hub.

If you have any issues or questions, email the email address below, or open an issue at:

#Usage#

Each post or page will have a new meta-box upon activation of the plugin. From here you can set the image for the hub using Wordpress's new Media Uploader. You can also set the order in which pictures appear.

To add to your page or theme you can use the short code [hub].

Alternatively, you can use the function hub\_shortcode(array()).

Currently there are no options and you can only have one site-wide hub. This shouldn't be too hard to modify for your needs.
